## üéØ Architecture Overview

FamilyTales follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        MOBILE[Flutter Mobile]
        WEB[Flutter Web]
    end

    subgraph "API Layer"
        API[Rust API Server]
        WORKER[Background Workers]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        POSTGRES[(PostgreSQL)]
        REDIS[(Redis)]
        MUX[Mux Storage]
    end

    MOBILE --> API
    WEB --> API
    API --> POSTGRES
    API --> REDIS
    WORKER --> POSTGRES
    WORKER --> MUX
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Family-First**: Everything is designed around family sharing and collaboration
2. **Privacy-Focused**: Documents are processed securely with end-to-end encryption
3. **Performance**: Sub-second audio streaming globally via Mux CDN
4. **Scalability**: Microservices architecture with horizontal scaling
5. **Cost-Effective**: Rust backend provides excellent performance per dollar

## üì± Core Features

### Document Processing Pipeline

1. **üì∏ Capture** - Mobile camera with auto-enhancement
2. **üîç OCR** - Google Vision API for text extraction
3. **‚úèÔ∏è Correction** - Family collaborative text editing
4. **üéôÔ∏è Audio** - Natural TTS with multiple voice options
5. **üì§ Distribution** - Instant family sharing with HLS streaming

### Family Management

- **Multi-Family Support** - Users can belong to multiple families
- **Role-Based Permissions** - Owners, admins, members, and view-only
- **Invitation System** - Beautiful email invites and QR codes
- **Memory Books** - Organized collections with threading

### Subscription Model (MVP)

- **14-Day Free Trial** - All features, credit card required upfront
- **Free Tier (Post-Trial)** - 3 stories/month, basic voices, 5 family members
- **Family Plan** - $14.99/month, unlimited stories and family members

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Rust**: Follow `rustfmt` and `clippy` recommendations
- **Flutter**: Use `dart format` and `flutter analyze`
- **Commits**: Conventional commits with clear descriptions
- **Testing**: Maintain >80% code coverage

### API Design

- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Versioned**: All endpoints under `/v1/`
- **Documented**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Consistent**: Standard response format across all endpoints

### Security

- **Authentication**: Clerk JWT tokens for all requests
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3+ for all communications
- **Audit**: All data access is logged

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Feature Development

1. **Research** - Understand existing codebase patterns
2. **Plan** - Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Implement** - Write code with tests
4. **Review** - Peer review with security focus
5. **Deploy** - Automated CI/CD pipeline

### Code Quality Gates

```bash
# Run before committing
make fmt      # Format code
make test     # Run all tests
make lint     # Static analysis
make audit    # Security audit
```

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - Individual features
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics (Prometheus)

- API response times and error rates
- Document processing success rates
- User engagement metrics
- Resource utilization

### Logging (Structured JSON)

- Request/response correlation
- Business event tracking
- Error aggregation and alerting
- Performance monitoring

### Tracing (Jaeger)

- Distributed request tracing
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Service dependency mapping

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Development Environment

```bash
# Database connection issues
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d postgres

# Rust compilation errors
cargo clean && cargo build

# Flutter hot reload not working
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

#### Production Issues

```bash
# Check API health
curl https://api.familytales.app/health

# View logs
kubectl logs -n familytales deployment/familytales-api

# Check database connections
kubectl exec -n familytales postgres-0 -- psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```
