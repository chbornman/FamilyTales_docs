## Organization Tips Based on These Examples

### For Traditional Families:
- Organize by person, then by theme
- Chronological within each theme
- Separate military/professional from personal

### For Blended Families:
- Maintain separate heritage sections
- Create "Our Story" for combined history
- Give equal weight to both sides

### For Digital Natives:
- Use multimedia chapters
- Create annual time capsules
- Include modern formats (texts, social media)

### For Memorial Collections:
- Lead with their own words
- Organize tributes by relationship
- Include celebration/funeral content
- Plan for ongoing additions

### For Minimalists:
- One Memory Book per major theme
- No complex threading needed
- Focus on quality over organization
