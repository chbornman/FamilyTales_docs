# OCR Technology Research for FamilyTales

## 1. OCR Technology Overview

### What is OCR?
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the technology that converts different types of documents—such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera—into editable and searchable text data.

### Handwriting Recognition (ICR/IWR)
- **ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition)**: Focuses on recognizing individual handwritten characters
- **IWR (Intelligent Word Recognition)**: Recognizes entire handwritten words, providing better context understanding
- **Modern AI-Based Recognition**: Uses deep learning models trained on millions of handwriting samples

### Key Technical Challenges
- Variability in handwriting styles (print vs. cursive vs. mixed)
- Document quality (fading, stains, tears, fold marks)
- Historical documents with obsolete writing styles
- Multi-language support and special characters
- Contextual understanding for ambiguous characters

## 2. Current State of Handwriting Recognition

### Accuracy Benchmarks (2024)
Based on current research and testing:

#### Modern Clear Handwriting
